title: Challenges of machine learning for autonomous driving
abstract: <p>Assisted and autonomous vehicles are safety-critical systems that  have to cope in real-time with complex, hard-to-predict, dynamic environments. Training (and testing) the underlying models require massive amounts of fully-annotated driving data, which is not sustainable. Focusing on perception, several projects at valeo.ai toward training better models with less supervision will be presented.</p>
bio: <p>Patrick Perez is Scientific Director of valeo.ai, an AI research lab focused on Valeo automotive applications, self-driving cars in particular. Before joining Valeo, Patrick PÃ©rez has been a researcher at Technicolor (2009-2018), Inria (1993-2000, 2004-2009) and Microsoft Research Cambridge (2000-2004).
